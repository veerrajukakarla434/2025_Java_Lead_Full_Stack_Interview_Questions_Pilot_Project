# Java Performance Tuning
* ** Not Covered Topics
* Microbenchmarking
* Statistical measurements
* Database query tuning
* Concurrency basics


* **Covered Topics**
* Understand your performance characteristics
* Java application profiling
* JVM tuning
* Search and data structers
* Memory management
* Optimizing concurrent code
* Avoding doing expensive operations

 #### Performance and Computer Hardware

  * Requests per second
  * Queries per second
  * Frames per Second
  * Operations per Second
  * Instructions per Second
* The better machine, the more instructions it can execute per second
  
#### System Performance Metrics
* Utilization, Saturation and Errors Method (USE)
#### One of the methodology is USE methodology  with repect to below components

 * CPU
 * Memory
 * Disk Capacity
 * Disk I/O
 * Nettwork I/O

#### Example Thread Pool

 * **Thread Pools** : Utilization -> number of threads currently executing tasks
 *  **Staturation** : number of items working for the threads
 *  ..etc
